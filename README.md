# Introduction

Time $pent is an app made to help users see time differently and use it more effetively. You are given a 'budget' (total number of minutes in a day) and can go about 'spending' this time much like you would real money, hence the whole '$pent' gimmick. After entries have been made into the recorded and planned categories, charts will be populated with the data from your daily activity to offer visualizations on how your time was spent. 

# Directions

The app's interface has three columns for the user to interact with. The 'Records' column is for keeping track of things that you have already done. For example if it's 7:30 AM and you just woke up and took a walk, you would record 'sleep' and 'walk', how long in minutes each task took, and other descriptive details of these events.

The To Do's column is to organize future events that you plan on doing but have not yet had a chance to complete. When you complete one of these future events, you can mark them as completed to send them to the records.
 
The last column is the totals section which basically does all of the math for the app. The resulting totals give the user some information to further plan the remainder of the day. As data is entered into the app and time passes, the charts at the top of each column will change to represent the different metrics being tracked.
